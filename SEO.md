 I have implemented a comprehensive SEO and AI SEO strategy for the project. This includes:

   * Dynamic Meta Tags: I've created a reusable SEO component to manage meta tags (title, description,
     keywords, etc.) dynamically across the application. This component is implemented on the home page,
     agencies page, agency detail page, and booking page.
   * `robots.txt`: I've created a robots.txt file to instruct search engine crawlers on how to index your
     site.
   * Sitemap: I've created a dynamic sitemap generation script that creates a sitemap.xml file, which helps
     search engines discover all the pages on your site.
